Developed a scalable library management system with a group of peers to digitise and automate a library as well as reduce the need for face-to-face interactions using MySql, Python, OpenCV. 

Automated the process of borrowing and returning books, calculating penalties for late returns and giving data insights on reader trends using graphs to help with the procurement of new books. Created a system that scans the ID card to log in to the system and recognises the books being borrowed and returned using Computer Vision
